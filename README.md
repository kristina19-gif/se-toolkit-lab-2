# Lab 01 – Products, Architecture & Roles

To kickstart the course, you will explore two things:
>
> 1) How real software products are structured;
> 2) What kind of engineers build and operate them.
>
## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of modules, data flow, and deployment.
- Identify which tech roles work on which parts of that product, and which general skills are shared across roles.
- Use GitHub issues, branches, and pull requests (PRs) to structure your work and get a peer review.

## Tasks overview

To complete this lab, you will need to:

- Pick an existing digital product.
- Sketch its architecture: modules, data flow, deployment.
- Map modules to tech roles and skills using real job postings and `roadmap.sh`.
- Practice using GitHub issues, branches and pull requests (PRs) to organize your work in a repository (repo) and get feedback from peers.

This and all other lab assignments will simulate the engineering practices in a real team:

- Follow processes;
- Communicate via issues/PRs;
- Keep the work reviewable.

## Repo structure

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` – templates for your issues.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` – a template for PRs.

## Main tasks

You work **independently** on the tasks below in your forked repo.

When you're done with a task, you ask your collaborator to review your PR created for that task.

The exact flow for each task is `Issue -> PR -> Review`:

- [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) a GitHub issue in your forked repo using one of the suggested issue types.
- [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) a new branch for the issue.
- Implement the task on the new branch.
- [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) a PR to the `main` branch.
- Request a review of the PR from the collaborator.
- Make necessary changes based on the review.
- Get the collaborator to approve the PR.
- Merge the PR to the `main` branch.
- Close the issue.

Be ready to demonstrate the completed tasks to the TA at the end of the lab.

### 1. Pick a product & describe its architecture (text)

1. Create an issue `[Task] Product & architecture description`.
2. Create a branch for it.

3. In `docs/architecture.md`, write:
    1. **Product choice (5–7 sentences)**
        - Pick one product from this list or propose your own:
            - Yandex Taxi
            - Telegram
            - ChatGPT
            - Wildberries
            - Uchi.ru
            - Any other widely used fullstack app (agree with TA if picking this option).
        - Explain why you personally would be interested to work on this product as a tech specialist.
    2. **Modules & data flow**
        - Describe the main system **modules** in your own words. For example:
            - Mobile app
            - Backend API
            - Authentication service
            - Payment / billing
            - Notifications
            - Admin panel
            - Data analytics
        - For each module:
            - 1–2 sentences: what it does.
        - Then add a short section “**Data flow**”:
            - Describe what happens when a typical user action occurs (e.g. user orders a taxi / sends a message).
            - Mention which modules talk to each other and what kind of data they exchange.
    3. **Deployment (high level)**
        - Briefly describe **where** these modules live:
            - On user devices (mobile/web).
            - On servers (backend services, databases).
            - In the cloud (if you know/guess).
    4. **Uncertainties (very important)**
        - Add a section:

            ```markdown
            ## Things I am not sure about
            
            1. ...
            2. ...
            ```

            Write at least two things in your architecture that you are not fully sure about (guesses, questions, etc.).
4. Commit your changes with a clear message, e.g.:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/architecture
    git add docs/architecture.md
    git commit -m "describe modules and data flow for <product>"
    git push -u origin feature/architecture
    ```

5. Open a PR to `main`:
    - Link it to the issue (`Closes #<issue_number>`).
    - Request a review from a collaborator.
6. Continue with next tasks, the reviews will be done in Task 4.

### 2. Draw the architecture diagram

Create an issue:

- `[Task] Architecture diagram`
Work on the same product.

1. Using **draw.io**, draw a diagram that shows:
    - Main modules as boxes.
    - Arrows showing how data flows between them for a typical user action.
    - A separation (if possible) between:
        - Client-side (mobile/web).
        - Server-side services.
        - Data storage (databases, caches, etc.).
2. Export the diagram to **PNG or SVG** and save as:
    - `diagrams/architecture.png` (or `.svg`)
    If your tool supports it, also save the **source file**:
    - `diagrams/architecture.drawio` (or equivalent).
3. Add a short caption inside `docs/architecture.md`:

    ```markdown
    ## Diagram
    
    See `diagrams/architecture.png` for a visual representation of the modules and data flow.
    ```

4. Commit and push your changes on the same branch to extend the PR.

> 💡 **LLM check:**
>
> - LLMs can help you **decide what boxes/arrows to include**, but the **diagram must be drawn by you**.
>
> - The TA will ask you to verbally explain the diagram.
>

### 3. Roles, skills, roadmap.sh & job postings

Create an issue:

- `[Task] Roles and skills mapping`
Work in branch `feature/roles-skills`.

1. In `src/roles-and-skills.md`, add the following sections.

   #### 3.1 Roles per module

    - For each major module from `architecture.md`, list **which tech roles** are likely involved.
        - Example: `Backend API` → backend engineer, DevOps, QA engineer, product manager.
    - Use a simple table:

        ```markdown
        | Module            | Roles involved                         |
        |-------------------|----------------------------------------|
        | Mobile app        | Mobile engineer (iOS/Android), QA     |
        | Backend API       | Backend engineer, DevOps, QA          |
        | ...               | ...                                    |
        ```

   #### 3.2 Cross-cutting skills

    - Add a section:

        ```markdown
        ## Common skills across roles
        ```

    - Based on your intuition and some research, list **skills that almost everyone needs**, for example:
        - Git
        - Basic Linux usage
        - Understanding of HTTP / REST APIs
        - Communicating in a team
        - Writing clear issues/PR descriptions

   #### 3.3 Choose a role and visit roadmap.sh

    - Choose **one role** that seems most interesting to you now  
        (e.g. backend, DevOps, frontend, mobile, data engineer, etc.).
    - Go to [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/), find the relevant roadmap and sign in.
    - Spend a few minutes marking items you **already have at least some knowledge in**.
    - In your markdown file, write:

        ```markdown
        ## My chosen role
        
        - Role: <name>
        - Skills I already have (from roadmap.sh): ...
        - Skills I clearly lack (from roadmap.sh): ...
        ```

   #### 3.4 Job postings (Headhunter)

    - Find **2–3 job postings** for this role on Headhunter (or a similar job site).
    - For each posting, list:
        - Link to the posting.
        - Company name.
        - Role title.
        - 3–5 key skills/requirements they mention.
    - Then write a short comparison:

        ```markdown
        ## Job market snapshot
        
        - Skills that appear in almost every posting:
          - ...
        - Skills that surprised me:
          - ...
        - My key take away:
          - ...
        ```

2. Commit and push your changes, open a PR and link it to the issue.

> 💡 **LLM check:**
>
> - You can ask an LLM “what does a *role* usually do?”, but:
>
>   - You must visit roadmap.sh and real job postings yourself.
>
>   - Your reflections about what you have / don’t have must be honest and personal.
>
---

### 4. Peer review via PR

Create an issue:

- `[Task] Code review for Lab 01`
You will act as both **author** and **reviewer**.

1. As an **author**:
    - Create two **PRs** that:
        - Adds `docs/architecture.md` with the diagram.
        - Adds `src/roles-and-skills.md`.
    - Request a review from a collaborator for at least one of the PRs.
    - Use the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) and make sure the PR descriptions are clear and links the relevant issue(s).
2. As a **reviewer**:
    - Review at least **one PR** from a collaborator.
    - Leave at least **2 meaningful comments** to improve your colleagues work, which they need to address. For example:
        - A question about architecture (“Why does the mobile app talk directly to the database?”).
        - Some important commonly-appearing skills weren't mentioned.
3. As an **author**, address the comments:
    - Make changes where reasonable.
    - Reply to comments with something like “Fixed in 123abc” (123abc being the commit id) or explain why you disagree.
4. When both sides are happy, **merge the PR**.

> 💡 **LLM check:**
>
> - You can ask an LLM “how to phrase a polite review comment”,  
>     but you must read your collaborator’s work and think of **real feedback**.
>
---

### 5. Short personal reflection

Create an issue:

- `[Task] Personal reflection – Lab 01`

1. In `src/reflection.md` write 5–10 sentences answering:
    - Which role did you choose and why?
    - What is one thing about the product’s architecture that was new to you?
    - Which course topics (Git, Linux, Docker, REST, CI/CD, fullstack, data) seem most relevant to your chosen role?
    - What is one concrete skill you would like to improve this semester?
2. Commit, push, and (optionally) open a small PR, or add it to an existing one.

> 💡 **LLM check:**
>
> - Write this section **without** an LLM. It’s about your own thoughts.
>
---

### 6. Stretch tasks (optional)

If you finish early:

- Add a second diagram showing **only backend services** and how they might scale (load balancer, multiple service instances, database).
- Create a file `src/agent-idea.md`:
  - Sketch how an “agent/script” could:
    - Read `LAB_STORY.md`,
    - Generate GitHub issues automatically via API,
    - Create initial markdown files for you.
- Try to implement a tiny part of that agent (even just a script that reads this file and prints task titles).

---

### Submission checklist

Report each task to the TA when you’re done:

- The tasks must have an **issue** linked to PRs.
- Close the issue when all related activities (including TA approval) are done.
- Explain your diagram, chosen role in a short conversation with the TA.
